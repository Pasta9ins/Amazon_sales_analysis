The goal of this project was to analyze raw sales data and answer key business questions relevant to e-commerce growth. By leveraging SQL, I explored sales trends, product performance, and customer profitability to showcase how structured queries can drive business decisions.

## üîç Project Overview  

The goal of this project was to **analyze raw sales data** and answer **key business questions** relevant to e-commerce growth. By leveraging SQL, I explored **sales trends, product performance, and customer profitability** to showcase how structured queries can drive business decisions.  


## üöÄ Key Highlights  

- Performed **data preprocessing & feature engineering** using SQL (cleaning nulls, standardizing values, creating derived fields).  
- Wrote **optimized SQL queries** to resolve real-world business problems.  
- Derived **insights on customer profitability, product trends, and state-wise performance**.  
- Applied **aggregate functions, window functions, joins, and CTEs** for complex analysis.  


## Business Questions Resolved

1. Find total sales for each category.
2. Find out the top 5 customers who made the highest profits.
3. Find out the average quantity ordered per category.
4. Identify the top 5 products that have generated the highest revenue.
5. Determine the top 5 products whose revenue has decreased compared to the previous year.
6. Identify the highest profitable sub-category.
7. Find out the states with the highest total orders.
8. Determine the month with the highest number of orders.
9. Calculate the profit margin percentage for each sale (Profit divided by Sales).
10. Calculate the percentage contribution of each sub-category

## Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the raw sales data files.
- `sql/`: Includes SQL scripts for data cleaning, Columns creation, and analysis.
- `README.md`: Provides an overview of the project, including its objectives, features, and structure.


## Requirements

- SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).


üëâ This project strengthened my ability to **translate raw business data into structured insights** using SQL alone, without relying on external tools.
